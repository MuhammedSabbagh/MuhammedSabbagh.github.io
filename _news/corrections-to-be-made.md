## first of all

thanks for aaron for being the first supporter, it means alot to me as indie Blog writer! since i want to make the Blog more of Quality than Quantity i decieded to remove the older Blog Posts to either rewrite them or write more read worthy articles, there are alot in my mind so i want to focus on doing more important things first.

## Knowledge Garden Progress

Right now, it's taking shape, getting some traction in term of pages number, the idea of that blog is to make complex studying materials more tame and easy to understand, that, or provide links to other articles that could do more help than me, the main focus of it will be more on Math, Programming,Electronics, and Philosophy\Theology with possibilty to extend to other fields
later, the idea isn't abandoned it simply needs to be gently cooked because i want to be Impressed from the results myself before anyone else.

## Ramadan, University, Blogging, Studying All at the same time

i'm writing this in the month of ramadan so i'm fasting through the day while attending University and sometimes doing Tarawih Prayers at night and also having to find time to study University's Studying Materials, so i don't have lots of time to occupy on writing as much as i used to.

## Final Word

the Knowledge Garden has a deadline of mid-late april as it needs time to get more pages written (Otherwise it's a normal deserted mkdoc!), and i need to organize my time better so yeah, that's about it, Peace!
