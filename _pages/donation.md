Donations helps me keep going whether in life or in university or basicly anywhere.

Computer engineering is an ever-evolving field, and it requires a lot of hard work and dedication to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies. By donating, you are helping me provide the necessary resources for someone who is actively pursuing their education in this field.

and since i currently have no job this blog is my only personal income so it means alot to me if you help even a small amount!

i'm planning to enable a buy me a coffee account or ko-fi but right now all i have is donation using digital currency.

right now i accept:

> Bitcoin (BTC): 172nntRRh7btAXiJqKSAzjQnYETxJ1o1FS

> Tether (USDT): 0x1423d41b0bef4457bf8199dcd4abddcb382b3790

> Monero (XMR): 42ZX37WxJndAYoS7jcAZsoPR28ZgziEWgBnDEFhF1HVeR3Gps1zwedsZc9xpiGhxF3S4fsYfvmeCqf6VnrHTdTwqK8Xab8U

it isn't mandatory but deeply appreciated!
