Donations helps me keep doing good at life or at university or basicly anywhere.

Computer engineering is an ever-evolving field, and it requires a lot of hard work and dedication to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies. By donating, you are helping me provide the necessary resources for someone who is actively pursuing their education in this field.

and since i currently have no job this blog is my only personal income so it means alot to me if you help even a small amount!
