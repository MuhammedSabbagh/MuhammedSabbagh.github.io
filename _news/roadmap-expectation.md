## The Roadmap

there will be a planned roadmap to this blog as this won't only a "Blog for writing selfish posts" but a gate to a much bigger ambitions, i'm planning to open a section where anything i know off (or atleast as much as i could) into a sub-section called "The knowledge gate" this section will focus on sorting everything i know into a (read the docs) style, be it in programming or electronics or even math!

## commissions

i may start taking commissions for writing articles similar to what is being written in the near future on this blog for a price later decided.

## projects

i will post projects relating to Electronic circuits, arduinos, and automating in its section so people can benefit from it, which will also happen later.

## donations

i'm not sure exactly how will donations will work whether with crypto or e-pay however there should be one to sustain the work of this blog and keeping it working and that will also be decided later on

## a final word

i hope everything goes well for this blog because i'm putting all the shots into magnum opus and since it's a big project it won't happen in a day and night, hope this benefits the reader and benefits me as well, this won't be all but i'm eager to begin working more than to announce it all.

peace.
