## What am I going to do now?

now that I have rested from long burnout it's time to move on yet again, seeâ€¦ the start inside was deeply passionate as I was looking to make the magnum opus of a blog, but, thinking of it deeply many others have done and so it's leaving no where for me to be on the competition and keep up with others, so I will resort to other fields.

Knowledge Gate is still an Idea, and by allah's grace will be a project, and a very big one indeed but for the time being it will -for the most part- remain an idea.

finding a way to monetize my works is also very favorable now more than ever as this will put much ease to me and my family, and so I might start making courses about what I know, obviously in a way that bring huge benefit to learners and me all along.

recently I had finale in Numerical Analysis and I really wanted to learn how certain things is done ie: horner method, cholesky method, LU etc., finding such thing in a tide and neat way whether on YouTube or other sites was hard, so I'm planning to make a platform (maybe with in the Blog) where it goes just like the University course where a PDF is along with a video explaining it, this can save student humongous amount of time, and marks for people in need of it, and putting special access for more benefits like requests for a video explaining specific X thing in math\code etc.

Finally, I hope it just works, entering from multiple doors is much wiser and better than all entering from one door, and so we are doing it like this, might be exhausting to me, maybe this is the norm, or maybe I'm just exaggerating, but I'm hoping for the best, thank you.
