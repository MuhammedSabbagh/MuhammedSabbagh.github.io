it was 4 am in the morning, i just went to sleep an hour earlier and what was a calm another uneventual night turned into a first hand dystopian nightmare; the house was shaking so violently, the door was closed but was rattling so loudly that even when i tried to stop it i fail, it lasted 40 seconds but was more than enough to keep us just terrified for basicly the whole day.
i'm not a tough guy but i tried to keep myself calm as much as i can but trying to calm my mom down was by itself a whole problem.

you see, when you see your mother calm and content you feel safe and content as well, but when she is terrified and shievering even if you were the toughest guy on earth you will feel scared and overwhelmed..

eventually the earthquake stopped leaving a resounding silence for a min before everysingle soul outside decided to rush off their homes and run for their lifes, sounds of civil defence trucks, ambulance, and people beeping off on their cars filled the city, that was another scare into what was already bad enough frightning event.. oh and mind me saying that was before another several giant aftershocks >5 occured INCLUDING another 7.5m 6 hours later. it stayed like this for few days and we were basicly hallucinating from the shaking.

this disaster left a big scar in my heart in everysingle way, from the victims of the earthquake (may allah swt bless them all) to the public coverage to basicly everything else.

i hope we never experience things like this again at least in the near future because we are tired

also sorry if this was the first blog to write after rehauling but had nothing in mind currently except this :(

fear not tho!, because i have some good plans for this blog and a roadmap will be published soon!

peace and have a great day!
